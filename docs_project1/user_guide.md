### Dashboard

Track your study sessions in two modes:

-   Ongoing Event: When you log in during a scheduled calendar event, a timer automatically appears and counts down the time remaining in that session. You can also view details of your current event - title and description - with the latter containing a list of the Leetcode problems added for this event (if any).

-   Custom Session: If no event is active, you can start a manual timer. Enter your desired time in minutes in the form field. Toggle your timer with the Start, Pause, and Reset controls.

### Note: Live countdowns require JavaScript. If JavaScript is disabled in the browser, the timer will be static and a "Refresh" button is provided that will update the time countdown display on click.
