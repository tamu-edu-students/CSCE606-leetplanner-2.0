    -   **Planning:** All team members planned to work on increasing the project's test coverage by the weekend and then start on their assigned development features.

-   **Oct 28:**
    -   **Progress:** Sprint 1 features were nearing completion. @Shivam Mishra had completed testing. @Shreya Sahni had completed development for her 4 issues and was finalizing test cases. @Mohammed Sharique had closed his issues and was also finishing test cases. @Venkata Sai Nithin had completed his test cases and implemented basic whiteboard functionality (adding shapes).
    -   **Workflow:** The team discussed a new deployment plan to use a new Heroku instance.

#### **Sprint 1 Review & Retrospective**

-   **Date:** October 29, 2025

-   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the work completed during Sprint 1 and reflect on the team's process to identify areas for improvement.

**Sprint Review (Demo & Discussion):**
(This meeting was held in the presence of Professor Ritchie on 10/29).
-   **Completed Work:** The team successfully demonstrated the core features from the "Collaborative Lobbies" epic.
    -   **Lobby Creation & Management:** Users can create public/private lobbies, invite others, and manage participant permissions.
    -   **Real-Time Whiteboard:** A shared whiteboard was demoed, allowing participants to draw, erase, and clear the board with low latency.
    -   **Synchronized Shared Notes:** A real-time, auto-saving notes editor was presented.

-   **Backlog Spillover (Unfinished Work):**
    -   **Bug:** A bug was found in the "Manage Lobby Permissions" feature.
    -   **Tech Debt:** The story for "Increasing Test Coverage" (especially for Cucumber) was not fully completed and will be moved to the next sprint.
    -   **New Story:** Based on the demo, a new item was created to "Improve Whiteboard Functionality".

**Sprint Retrospective (Process Improvement):**

-   **What could be improved?**
    -   Team communication needs to be more frequent to provide visibility on progress and blockers outside of formal meetings.

-   **Action Item:** Team members will give more frequent, informal updates on shared tasks.

    -   The team successfully implemented a complex set of features, including real-time collaboration (whiteboard, notes) and new JS-based analytics.
    -   **Massive Test Coverage Improvement:** The team successfully addressed the technical debt from Sprint 1, bringing Cucumber coverage up from 43% to 90%.
    -   The team adapted to new requirements (AI chatbot) and was well-prepared for final documentation and presentation.

-   **What could be improved?**
    -   **Task Definition:** The team noted that issue descriptions should be expanded and story points should be added earlier in the process to improve planning.
    -   **Documentation:** Documentation (ADRs, diagrams) was left until the final days, adding pressure. This should be an ongoing task in future projects.
